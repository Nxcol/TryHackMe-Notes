# Shodan Practice Report – Apache Servers in US

## 🎯 Task
Search for Apache servers in the United States using Shodan.  
Identify exposed versions, note potential risks, and provide recommendations.  

## 🔍 Findings
1. **Apache 2.4.6 (CentOS)**
   - Host: demosmoscareoptimized.com (AWS, US)
   - Risk: Very outdated (released 2013). Contains many known vulnerabilities (DoS, privilege escalation, etc.).

2. **Apache 2.4.58 (Ubuntu)**
   - Host: helpdesk.ptdata.co.uk (DigitalOcean, UK)
   - Risk: Recent version (released 2023). Lower risk, but still requires ongoing patching.

## ⚠️ Risks
- Apache 2.4.6 has numerous CVEs, making it an easy target if unpatched.
- Outdated services exposed on the internet increase the attack surface.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Upgrade Apache 2.4.6 to the latest supported release.
- Regularly patch and update web servers.
- Limit public exposure of services to only what’s necessary.
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity.

## 📝 Notes
- Data gathered only via Shodan’s search engine (no interaction with systems).
- Purpose: Learning and practicing asset discovery and vulnerability assessment.

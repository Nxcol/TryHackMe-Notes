# TryHackMe-Notes
Summaries of labs/rooms I've completed in cybersecurity.  
This repo serves as a **portfolio** to show my hands-on skills.# DIRB - Web Content Scanner

DIRB is a web content scanner that brute-forces hidden files and directories on a website.  
I practiced it in a lab environment (TryHackMe).
